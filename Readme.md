This project is a team project with limitted time, and the final submission would be the presentation slides. (Yes, I'm trying to find an excuse for my messy code files.) Some code files are from other members of the team.

The data are provided by a real estate incesting company. The project goal is to build a deployable model used to predict "time to sell"- how long it will take a new listing from the published to sale.

We've signed the confidentiality agreement, we can't share the data this time. The code files are only for reference. You could better understand our work via the slides(.pptx file). If you are intersted with any part of this project. Feel free to contact with me. (huimin.han3@gmail.com)
