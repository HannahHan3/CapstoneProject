Before getting start with this project, I want to say that I have to admit that my code files are quite messy. I learned coding by myself in the early beginning, hadn't take any programming language courses, making me not formed good coding habits (And I even didn't realize my bad coding habits at that time) . Bad coding habits have hurted myself these days, when I tried to organized previous projects and uploaded them to github. I'm still working on "cleaning" my own coding files these days. If the code file you are currently opening is very messy and badly named, please forgive me, I am trying to tidy it up. Some code files are from other members of the team, and I also need to communicate with them to complete. Thank you for your understanding.

This is a capstone team project. The data are provided by a real estate incesting company. The project goal is to build a deployable model used to predict "time to sell"- how long it will take a new listing from the published to sale.

We've signed the confidentiality agreement, we can't share the data this time. The code files are only for reference. You could better understand our work via the slides(.pptx file). If you are intersted with any part of this project. Feel free to contact with me.
