This is a capstone team project. The data are provided by a real estate incesting company. The project goal is to build a deployable model used to predict "time to sell"- how long it will take a new listing from the published to sale.

We've signed the confidentiality agreement, we can't share the data this time. The code files are only for reference. You could better understand our work via the slides(.pptx file). If you are intersted with any part of this project. Feel free to contact with me.
